Golden leaves gently fall from the trees, reminding us that autumn is coming. The air is filled with a special smell of mushrooms and rain. However, despite the cold winds, autumn gives us real pleasure - beautiful landscapes and warm evenings with hot tea.</i>

    <i><b>With</b> the onset of winter, nature covers itself with a white blanket, as if hiding from us under a quiet veil. The air is permeated with cold and freshness, the body feels life-giving energy. The real winter element is raging, when snowflakes fall from the sky like diamonds, and the earth seems bewitching. In the winter forest, the quiet crunch of snow underfoot sounds, and sunny days are unusually beautiful against the backdrop of white expanses.</i>
